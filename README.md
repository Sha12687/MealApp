# MealApp
This project is a web application that utilizes the power of vanilla JavaScript to provide a seamless user experience. The main feature of the app is its ability to search for food recipes using the Themealdb API. The API returns a variety of data related to the searched recipe, such as ingredients, instructions, and nutritional information. The app then displays this information in an easy-to-read format, allowing users to quickly find the recipe they are looking for.
